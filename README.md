# Election-Website

I build this website as a final project in a full-stack course as a practical software engineer student.
It is all about the Knesset elections.
On the main page, you will see a countdown to the next Knesset election.
also a video about a decade of the Knesset and some statistics.
On the second, third, and fourth pages you will get pieces of information about each election.
On the fifth page informations about popular parties.
sixth page, a table for the Prime ministers of israel.
seventh page it is a link to get you information where you should go to vote.
