# Election-Website

I build this website as a final project in a full-stack course as a practical software engineer student.
It is all about the Knesset elections.

On the main page (main.html), you will see a countdown to the next Knesset elections.
Also a video about a decade of the Knesset and some statistics.

On the second (elections2020.html) , third (elections2019a.html), and fourth (elections2019b.html) pages you will get pieces of information about each election.

On the fifth page (popularParties.html) informations about popular political parties.

sixth page (primeMinisters.html) , a table for the Prime ministers of Israel.

the seventh page is a link to get you information on where you should go to vote.
